# Teams Jiggler

**Keep Microsoft Teams from marking you "Away" while you're working — even when you're reading, watching videos, or doing deep research.**

This crosshair-accurate macOS utility simulates real mouse movement and keypresses at safe intervals to ensure your status stays "Available" — without interfering with your workflow.

---

## 🧰 Features

- ✅ Mouse movement that Teams can't ignore
- ✅ Optional fake keypress (Shift) to simulate user input
- ✅ Logging to file for transparency & debugging
- ✅ Fully self-contained Python virtual environment
- ✅ Works via AppleScript for background running
- ✅ GitHub-friendly structure for easy sharing

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone this repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/teams-jiggler.git
   cd teams-jiggler
   ```

2. **Set up the Python virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Give macOS accessibility permissions**

   - Go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility`
   - Add permission for **Terminal** or **Visual Studio Code**
   - Also allow access for the `.app` if you export one

4. **Run it manually for testing**

   ```bash
   python jiggler.py
   ```

5. **(Optional) Run via AppleScript loop**
   ```bash
   osascript jiggler.applescript
   ```

---

## 🧪 How it Works

The script moves your mouse slightly and presses the Shift key every few minutes, which keeps Teams from detecting inactivity.

All activity is logged to `jiggler.log`.
